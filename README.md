# CMoC_project

Final project for CS 328: computational models of cognition. By James Yang and Gabriel Brookman.

We tried to make an LSTM that can generate titles for emails based on email text.

To run our model: process the data by running `data_cleaning.py` with python3, and then use `modeltrainer.py` (also with python3) to train the model.

You should have a subdirectory "saved" in the project directory, which will store the models after they're trained.
