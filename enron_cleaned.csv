38,i spoke with craig glazer the new director for pjm regarding their concept for pjm west which includes the following single market rules and tariffs for all companies no seams reliability criteria of existing control areas in ecar etc pjm west could use pjm market a power exchange such as apx could be established as a competitive option for day ahead transactions designed to be flexible native load exception is eliminated lmp transcos could be a part of it we talked at length about lmp and i suggested the hybrid as an option for a variety of reasons he does not believe the hybrid method will work because a study demonstrated that using past information to develop commercially significant flowgates does not work since the paths will change resulting in insufficient coverage of costs which would have to be socialized he further stated that there is insufficient data in the midwest to identify the constraints and we would have to rely on info provided by companies like aep given our current efforts to develop a single rto i think we should meet with the pjm folks and talk to them about our issues and see if we can come to some agreements craig thinks it is logical that fe might join pjm west i asked him if they were open to alternatives to lmp and he said he didnt know,2020.,pjm west

111,fyi to the executive committee attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off site and team building meetings my impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get togethers that require substantial travel our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time consuming for us to attend than our houston colleagues might realize often participating in these meetings takes an entire week for enron europe employees especially if they are outside of texas naturally they may feel that this time of year prc time is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering these off sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter which compounds the difficulty worse still are the times they occur at the end of q since it also coincides and conflicts with the prc process i would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs both direct and indirect when inviting international employees to off site meetings in the us we appreciate the chance to be included in the broader enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses thanks john sherriff letter sent to all enron europe vps and direct reports we still have issues regarding offsites and team building exercises in particular we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending in order to avoid misunderstandings and to increase transparency the following will apply with immediate effect any offsite or team building exercise which any group both commercial and non commercial and including john and myself intends to undertake must be communicated in advance to all department heads issue to be identified include all participants who will out of the office total costs of the exercise and where appropriate work load coverage details john and i are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends to the extent that is not possible we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered trips to houston and especially resorts in the us are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved so please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel please communicate this policy to your staff michael brown,2489.,transatlantic meetings

420,the attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the commission this afternoon in order to provide ferc staffers a concise effective statement of our position while they drafted the judges recommendation i was able to schedule a meeting with judge wagner at which dan watkiss and i stepped the judge through the comments and hit the following high points the methodology of the june order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers if price mitigation is inevitable the judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology the judge should recommend that the end result of any commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods both prior to and after october all buyers including enron should be entitled to refunds not just the state of california and its ious enron is a net purchaser in these markets only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology not bilateral contracts oom sales or sales to the dwr the details of these points appear in the attached document the judge was receptive to most points he understood the problems that the june methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation he agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology although he agreed that the refund methodology once implemented should yield just and reasonable rates he felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the commission the judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations but hopefully this insight will shed some light as to the outcome i urged the judge to recommend placing conditions to refunds as the commission did in its june order with its rto filing requirement the judge was noncommittal on this although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset next steps include filing our detailed comments by thursday the judge told us he would certify his recommendation to the commission on friday and that the comments would accompany the recommendation thereafter it is likely that the commission would defer to the judges recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of days duration to determine unresolved issues of material fact the scope of the hearing has not been determined but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology,7171.,preliminary comments on judges recommendation

470,today senators bob smith r nh and harry reid d nv will introduce an mtbe bill which is expected to be slightly different than weve seen in previous congresses we expect it to include a year date certain to eliminate mtbe with epa determining the phaseout schedule a lifting of the oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by state governors within days from date of enactment and environmental anti backsliding provision focused only on air toxics and using a baseline with a percent standard the way i understand it right now rfg must perform better than baseline for conventional gasoline provisions for mtbe producer transition assistance brief analysis well have more details shortly but the bill looks a little better than previous efforts a number of bills have been introduced this congress but this will probably be the leading effort as you know enron has led efforts to include the transition assistance piece which is still largely undefined in the legislation but we are pleased with the inclusion of a placeholder while the senate decides on the best approach we will continue to lead the development of such incentives which will likely take the form of epa doe funding for mtbe producers who convert plants to produce iso octane or alkylate an mtbe ban is of course not good but a date certain gives producers more flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under several steps of a phase out allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy standard is probably a given in any legislation but will face some opposition from the ethanol community who just want a simple mtbe ban the anti backsliding provision is still being refined but looks fairly lame we need more details to make an accurate assessment but its likely that environmental groups will want a bit more one political factor with sen jim jeffords leaving the republican party democrats will be given control of the senate environment committee which will consider this bill they will likely allow jeffords to chair the committee the significance is that sen bob smith r nh is the current chair and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on mtbe in losing the chairmanship his legislation may face a longer road through committee i will keep you posted as the legislation evolves jeffrey keeler director environmental strategies enron washington dc office cell phone,4762.,mtbe legislation

833,fyi rick this is very good and succinct summary from ban notwithstanding his analysis i think that we are going to be there for a longer than desired period and dr leys visit should have been kept for a more opportune time of course i hope that i am wrong it follows that the likely way out shall be renegotiation stabilizing then convergence with the arbitration route in existing best regards ai ban sharma am to amr ibrahim enron development enron development cc subject dr lays visit amr there have been differing perceptions about dr lays visit some including myself thought that it was a wasted effort esp so because just the day after he left the government of maharashtra called for a judicial probe against enron the terms of reference of the probe are to be announced within a month a judicial probe is not only a bad way to respond to our efforts but is also bound to postpone any fruitful negotiations its a bad signal esp for investors like us it shows poorly about how the indian polity works and how misplaced their priorities are esp on crucial infrastructure related issues some of us were beginning to think that dr lays visit is bound to enthuse the central government to act more positively and come with more likely solutions including a possible buyout however with a judicial probe being announced even the central government is forced to re think its strategy twice before stepping in infact it might be forced to take a back seat internal discussion reveal that it was perhaps necessary for dr lay to visit senior officials just to send a signal that enron had tried its utmost to thrash out a solution if necessary another visit would be planned just to reiterate this this they feel would help in the long run esp when we arbitrate to drive home the message that we did use all our options to arrive at a solution unlike the government which just was not forthcoming what folks here also feel is that the chairman of the company should definitely come to check the boxes so perhaps strategically it might appear that the latter school of thought is the right option but pragmatically sell out seems the only option left now the sooner the better however the way the judicial system works here one can only hope the supreme court respects our notice for arbitration in london and helps hasten the process ban,8742.,dr lays visit

959,the attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the commission this afternoon in order to provide ferc staffers a concise effective statement of our position while they drafted the judges recommendation i was able to schedule a meeting with judge wagner at which dan watkiss and i stepped the judge through the comments and hit the following high points the methodology of the june order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers if price mitigation is inevitable the judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology the judge should recommend that the end result of any commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods both prior to and after october all buyers including enron should be entitled to refunds not just the state of california and its ious enron is a net purchaser in these markets only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology not bilateral contracts oom sales or sales to the dwr the details of these points appear in the attached document the judge was receptive to most points he understood the problems that the june methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation he agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology although he agreed that the refund methodology once implemented should yield just and reasonable rates he felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the commission the judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations but hopefully this insight will shed some light as to the outcome i urged the judge to recommend placing conditions to refunds as the commission did in its june order with its rto filing requirement the judge was noncommittal on this although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset next steps include filing our detailed comments by thursday the judge told us he would certify his recommendation to the commission on friday and that the comments would accompany the recommendation thereafter it is likely that the commission would defer to the judges recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of days duration to determine unresolved issues of material fact the scope of the hearing has not been determined but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology,12967.,preliminary comments on judges recommendation

1041,folks had a good discussion with a senior staff member at ferc in preparation for the pipelines outreach meeting next week he told me that the two issues on the gas side that are of primary concern to the commission are marketing affiliates and potential abuse on the pipelines think el paso and the failure of cftc and or sec to more closely oversee derivative trading apparently staff is considering whether to ban all transactions by marketers on an affiliated pipeline and some form of filing reporting requirement to better understand the derivative market due to a lack of information some at ferc are assuming the worst i believe these proposals are in the formative stage and have not been presented to senior staff or commissioners as a recommendation i think staff would appreciate some information ammo to refute the need to further regulate marketing affiliates or delve into derivative trading ingaa filed comments and a study concerning marketers use of affiliated pipelines in response to the marketing affiliate conference at ferc these are attached staff questions whether the underlying information remains accurate we are considering whether to update the underlying information used in the ingaa study and how best to address these issues probably during q as during the staff outreach i believe it would be helpful to put back together the coalition that leslie lawner used at the last market affiliate conference to request a meeting as part of the current staff outreach to discuss staffs concerns in addition i think it would be helpful to request a separate enron meeting with staff to discuss how the derivative market works and why ferc does not need to establish ongoing reporting requirements or otherwise become involved in these markets unfortunately in this meeting we would probably be asked about our involvement in the el paso merchant transportation deal into california in light of peggy heggs comment on the frontline show that el paso hedged some of the risk with enron we can discuss further on fridays call later joe,3467.,ferc staff concerns on the gas side

1056,john brindle david cromley and others in the corporate business controls group formerly part of ebs have been working over the last several weeks to make sure that we can get our people out of dabhol if there are threats to their safety while no plan is perfectly reliable particularly during monsoon season we believe that we are as ready as we can be steve i wanted to give you the latest figures on enron expatriates in india there are currently enron expatriate employees based in india accompanied by six dependants in addition enron has responsibility for expatriate contractors working for dpc and lingtec primarily at dabhol the total of expatriates for whom enron is directly responsible is broken down by location as follows in mumbai at dabhol and three in baroda by company they are broken down as follows enron india eight plus three dependants eogil nine plus one dependant ebs one plus two dependants dpc seven and lingtec nine these figures are likely to continue to trend downward jane wilsons departure on friday for example will reduce the enron india expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants we are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the event of danger as a contingency the plan also includes the evacuation of all expatriates working at the dabhol site although a large scale evacuation from dabhol is more problematic especially now that the monsoon season has started a coordinated plan was needed since the limited number of available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by individual contractors such as bechtel were all drawing upon the same resources as you know enrons security situation in india remains stable we are in the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and offices there dave,12789.,enron expatriates in india

1060,after months of effort we have succeeded in putting together a blackout notification system that will provide california employers residents and public safety officers with adequate time to respond to an impending rolling blackout as you know governor davis appointed me to the california iso last february through the leadership of our energy committee at the manufacturing group i introduced a motion at caiso on march the motion stated that california needed a better blackout notification system than the passive system previously in place after the motion passed the iso and pg e held focus groups with employers and residents throughout the state to ask customers what they need to more adequately prepare for planned rolling blackouts and if possible to help prevent them from occurring then governor davis stepped in and directed iso the office of emergency services and the energy oversight board to work with the utilities to build a proactive notification system this system provides not only a hour advanced warning before a blackout could occur but to also includes and hour notices that blackouts might happen due to predicted hot weather conditions and or a lack of energy supply or planned and unplanned maintenance at generation facilities the proactive approach sought by governor davis and by my motion at caiso will include a system by which residents and employers can have their extensive contact information such e mails pagers and cell phones listed in a database all contacts can receive a and hour automatic notification in advance what is particularly exciting about this proactive approach is that we can better prepare for a blackout with adequate time to power down assembly lines and computers and power up emergency generators we can also prevent a blackout by taking action within that hour which reduces load and can even help avoid blackouts again kudos go to the manufacturing groups energy committee for pushing this plan last february to take to the caiso board and to governor davis by expanding this plan we can make sure an even larger window of notice is proactively provided to californians the plan will be rolled out publicly tomorrow friday june and incrementally implemented as soon as possible we will soon provide further updates on how employers throughout the valley and state on how they can register in the new database for this proactive notification system sincerely carl guardino winmail dat,27900.,blackout notification

1147,executive summary cpuc rules that socal must pay of debt to qfs approximately million ruling heightens likelihood of voluntary bankruptcy filing by socal voluntary filing further heightened by successful ring fencing by eix parent bankruptcy judge firm in support for qfs report socal loses cpuc ruling but retains appeal option as you may have seen bloomberg reported that the cpuc voted to force socal to make of its payments owed to alternative energy producers in california cpuc rules allow days to appeal its rulings leaving a window open for socal to buy more time voluntary filing in with regard to a socal bankruptcy filing the key now is how socals board feels about progress rather than deadlines with creditors in other words sources believe that a voluntary filing is more likely than an involuntary filing a continuing lack of progress on a bailout and an increase in the number of liens filed against socal is more likely to make the socal board want to file for bankrutpcy voluntarily the recent ring fencing by edison international reflects their need to pay off cross default risk and to cut ties in their bank facility between the parent company and lines of credit helds by socal in and of outself it does not necessarily signal an imminent filing involuntary out sources indicate that the unsecured financial creditors are not considering a filing against socal this is because the financial creditors believe that they would still be worse off in bankruptcy sources report that in creditor discussions there has not been talk of the debt holders not being paid people have talked about screwing the generators and everyone else but not the debt holders a source commented the qfs are unlikely to file against socal because they have fairly good contracts in place also they receive high capacity fees in the summer these fees vary seasonally and are distinct from generating fees these capacity fees are calculated on a rolling year basis and will be re calculated next year the qfs want this summer included in the recalculation incentivizing them to keep their contracts in place montali supporting qfs judge montali by his recent rulings is sending a signal that he is concerned for the qfs and is sensitive to their hardships he is trying to help them through his rulings for example as long as qfs remain on line those who petition can receive additional payments from pg e over a month period these payments equal of the qfs pre petition claims this provides the qfs incentive to remain connected to pg e ge looking to restructure generating capacity financing general electric is reportedly deeply concerned about the stability of financing generating capacity in the us ge has over of the gas turbine market ge is reportedly trying to keep its margins down and is not raising its prices due to concerns about instability sources believe that a very significant percentage of generating capacity financing will have to be restrucured in five years,27818.,california

1217,the following notes are from ken smith from state controller kathleen connells press conference today california state controller kathleen connell held a press conference today although the dow newswire said it would be to disclose long term contracts the event focused on what she believes will be an additional need for borrowing beyond the energy bonds she anticipates an additional billion in borrowing will be needed in february to meet expected costs the borrowing should she said be done as revenue anticipation notes rans short term notes at a lower interest rates about that must be paid back by the end of the year rather than as additional energy bonds she categorized the current budget situation as the same kind of environment as a bad budget year and said california should maintain at least a reserve she did not comment on individual contracts except to say there are different contracts charts her office had prepared showed that billion had been spent on energy purchases through about of that went to spot market purchases there was also a chart that showed projected expenditures under the governor s plan to be billion for the period january june with about of that going to spot market purchases how these numbers work together was confusing i checked with a reporter who said he was also unclear i ll try to get this cleared up this afternoon an easel held a large photocopy of a million check to mirant which is the largest energy check written to date more has been paid to reliant she put it at about of total expenditures but we have never written a check to reliant over million because of the way they invoice she said the governor s financial assumptions for power do not fit i nto the most likely scenario and that summer conditions will greatly affect the actual spending needs she noted that dwr estimates it will spend billion through june although the puc has only authorized billion the other significant announcement was that she plans to use her authority with the board of equalization to hold hearings to determine whether power plants sold by utilities have been properly assessed for property taxes apparently they are still on the tax rolls at previous rates but she believes the profits recorded by some generators means the plants may be more valuable than their current assessments a press release was not distributed at the event although there may be one issued later today,4815.,kathleen connell

1262,today senators bob smith r nh and harry reid d nv will introduce an mtbe bill which is expected to be slightly different than weve seen in previous congresses we expect it to include a year date certain to eliminate mtbe with epa determining the phaseout schedule a lifting of the oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by state governors within days from date of enactment and environmental anti backsliding provision focused only on air toxics and using a baseline with a percent standard the way i understand it right now rfg must perform better than baseline for conventional gasoline provisions for mtbe producer transition assistance brief analysis well have more details shortly but the bill looks a little better than previous efforts a number of bills have been introduced this congress but this will probably be the leading effort as you know enron has led efforts to include the transition assistance piece which is still largely undefined in the legislation but we are pleased with the inclusion of a placeholder while the senate decides on the best approach we will continue to lead the development of such incentives which will likely take the form of epa doe funding for mtbe producers who convert plants to produce iso octane or alkylate an mtbe ban is of course not good but a date certain gives producers more flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under several steps of a phase out allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy standard is probably a given in any legislation but will face some opposition from the ethanol community who just want a simple mtbe ban the anti backsliding provision is still being refined but looks fairly lame we need more details to make an accurate assessment but its likely that environmental groups will want a bit more one political factor with sen jim jeffords leaving the republican party democrats will be given control of the senate environment committee which will consider this bill they will likely allow jeffords to chair the committee the significance is that sen bob smith r nh is the current chair and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on mtbe in losing the chairmanship his legislation may face a longer road through committee i will keep you posted as the legislation evolves jeffrey keeler director environmental strategies enron washington dc office cell phone,8602.,mtbe legislation

1338,steve rick below is a brief description of dan recks recent acquisition of webmodal l please read the following message from dan reck regarding webmodal thank you daniel reck pm to cathy phillips hou ect ect cc subject webmodal at mondays egm meeting mike mcconnell asked me to describe the webmodal acquisition egm made last week following is a brief description of the freight capacity market and what webmodal gets us market the us market for logistics is bn annually we are pursuing the largest homogenous segment which is long haul truckload and intermodal that market is bn annually depending on who you ask and whether you include dedicated fleets the interesting thing about these markets is that they are extremely fragmented and massively intermediated there are over trucking companies carriers in the us and thousands of independent brokers brokers in this market act as credit principals of all loads are conducted in the spot market brokered and the rest are done under year contracts that are generally non firm but define the relationship between each shipper and their chosen carriers or intermediaries on the rail side the us railroads act as wholesalers selling their capacity to intermodal marketing companies imcs the imcs then retail or broker out that capacity to shippers the difficult part of ground intermodal is that the rail haul makes up only the long haul component the trip from the origin warehouse to the origin rail yard and then the delivery from the destination rail yard to the destination warehouse has to be done by truck this first and last mile transportation is called drayage webmodal webmodal developed a system to price and schedule intermodal moves so they look identical to truck they have a database with prices and schedules from all the rrs and drayage companies that gives them complete us coverage a buyer can type in their scheduling and equipment requirements and receive instantaneous quotes for zipcode to zipcode service because of the inherently different cost and performance structures of rail and truck the pricing differences between the two modes of transportation is significant for any move greater than miles intermodal is generally less expensive than a single driver truck move the substitutability of intermodal and truckload should allow us to trade the spread in price the webmodal acquisition gets us a team with tremendous industry expertise and a good head start as we enter this market the next move will be to build a truck intermediation capability i encourage you to meet chris kravas the ceo of webmodal he will be spending all of his time in houston when he is not on the road please give me a call if you have any questions thanks dan reck,2426.,webmodal

1440,today senators bob smith r nh and harry reid d nv will introduce an mtbe bill which is expected to be slightly different than weve seen in previous congresses we expect it to include a year date certain to eliminate mtbe with epa determining the phaseout schedule a lifting of the oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by state governors within days from date of enactment and environmental anti backsliding provision focused only on air toxics and using a baseline with a percent standard the way i understand it right now rfg must perform better than baseline for conventional gasoline provisions for mtbe producer transition assistance brief analysis well have more details shortly but the bill looks a little better than previous efforts a number of bills have been introduced this congress but this will probably be the leading effort as you know enron has led efforts to include the transition assistance piece which is still largely undefined in the legislation but we are pleased with the inclusion of a placeholder while the senate decides on the best approach we will continue to lead the development of such incentives which will likely take the form of epa doe funding for mtbe producers who convert plants to produce iso octane or alkylate an mtbe ban is of course not good but a date certain gives producers more flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under several steps of a phase out allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy standard is probably a given in any legislation but will face some opposition from the ethanol community who just want a simple mtbe ban the anti backsliding provision is still being refined but looks fairly lame we need more details to make an accurate assessment but its likely that environmental groups will want a bit more one political factor with sen jim jeffords leaving the republican party democrats will be given control of the senate environment committee which will consider this bill they will likely allow jeffords to chair the committee the significance is that sen bob smith r nh is the current chair and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on mtbe in losing the chairmanship his legislation may face a longer road through committee i will keep you posted as the legislation evolves jeffrey keeler director environmental strategies enron washington dc office cell phone,3387.,mtbe legislation

1460,the attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the commission this afternoon in order to provide ferc staffers a concise effective statement of our position while they drafted the judges recommendation i was able to schedule a meeting with judge wagner at which dan watkiss and i stepped the judge through the comments and hit the following high points the methodology of the june order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers if price mitigation is inevitable the judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology the judge should recommend that the end result of any commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods both prior to and after october all buyers including enron should be entitled to refunds not just the state of california and its ious enron is a net purchaser in these markets only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology not bilateral contracts oom sales or sales to the dwr the details of these points appear in the attached document the judge was receptive to most points he understood the problems that the june methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation he agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology although he agreed that the refund methodology once implemented should yield just and reasonable rates he felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the commission the judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations but hopefully this insight will shed some light as to the outcome i urged the judge to recommend placing conditions to refunds as the commission did in its june order with its rto filing requirement the judge was noncommittal on this although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset next steps include filing our detailed comments by thursday the judge told us he would certify his recommendation to the commission on friday and that the comments would accompany the recommendation thereafter it is likely that the commission would defer to the judges recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of days duration to determine unresolved issues of material fact the scope of the hearing has not been determined but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology,28563.,preliminary comments on judges recommendation

1465,the following notes are from ken smith from state controller kathleen connells press conference today california state controller kathleen connell held a press conference today although the dow newswire said it would be to disclose long term contracts the event focused on what she believes will be an additional need for borrowing beyond the energy bonds she anticipates an additional billion in borrowing will be needed in february to meet expected costs the borrowing should she said be done as revenue anticipation notes rans short term notes at a lower interest rates about that must be paid back by the end of the year rather than as additional energy bonds she categorized the current budget situation as the same kind of environment as a bad budget year and said california should maintain at least a reserve she did not comment on individual contracts except to say there are different contracts charts her office had prepared showed that billion had been spent on energy purchases through about of that went to spot market purchases there was also a chart that showed projected expenditures under the governor s plan to be billion for the period january june with about of that going to spot market purchases how these numbers work together was confusing i checked with a reporter who said he was also unclear i ll try to get this cleared up this afternoon an easel held a large photocopy of a million check to mirant which is the largest energy check written to date more has been paid to reliant she put it at about of total expenditures but we have never written a check to reliant over million because of the way they invoice she said the governor s financial assumptions for power do not fit i nto the most likely scenario and that summer conditions will greatly affect the actual spending needs she noted that dwr estimates it will spend billion through june although the puc has only authorized billion the other significant announcement was that she plans to use her authority with the board of equalization to hold hearings to determine whether power plants sold by utilities have been properly assessed for property taxes apparently they are still on the tax rolls at previous rates but she believes the profits recorded by some generators means the plants may be more valuable than their current assessments a press release was not distributed at the event although there may be one issued later today,3341.,kathleen connell

1487,steve as you requested attached please find the analyst compensation comparables we discussed last week we are having an extremely tough time recruiting analysts from rice because our main competition on campus comes from consulting companies bain mckinsey bcg ey andersen etc and investment banks goldman jp morgan csfb merrill lynch etc even though these companies are not directly in our industry group they are our principal competitors for talent at rice as evidenced by our recruiting performance this year and in previous years we loose nearly every time when we compete with these companies in the last three years of recruiting at rice only or people have accepted our offer the other analysts who are rice alumni myself included joined enron through other circumstances i think our poor performance at rice is due primarily to the following factors compensation the enron compensation package is below that of our competitors at rice additionally there is more risk associated with our offer since enrons compensation structure relies more heavily on the year end bonus than some of our competitors in the cases where the package is similar ie mckinsey we loose folks because of other companys name and prestige rotations most investment banks give their analysts offers to work in specific groups m a trading etc our analyst recruits can express a preference but their placement is not guaranteed this also creates an added element of risk and uncertainty in sum i think we will continue to be unsuccessful in our recruiting efforts at rice if we do not address these issues should you need any further information please feel free to contact me regards alex hernandez ena principal investments charlene as we discussed yesterday attached please find a comparable compensation analysis for this years analyst offers we believe that the low acceptance rate we are experiencing this year is due to the following reasons enrons base salary is significantly below that of our competitors the bonus ranges were not mentioned in the offer letters i hope this information is useful to you as we continue our efforts to attract quality employees to enron should you have any questions please feel free to contact me regards alex hernandez analyst advisory board x,6872.,rice recruiting analyst compensation comparables

1510,fyi rick this is very good and succinct summary from ban notwithstanding his analysis i think that we are going to be there for a longer than desired period and dr leys visit should have been kept for a more opportune time of course i hope that i am wrong it follows that the likely way out shall be renegotiation stabilizing then convergence with the arbitration route in existing best regards ai ban sharma am to amr ibrahim enron development enron development cc subject dr lays visit amr there have been differing perceptions about dr lays visit some including myself thought that it was a wasted effort esp so because just the day after he left the government of maharashtra called for a judicial probe against enron the terms of reference of the probe are to be announced within a month a judicial probe is not only a bad way to respond to our efforts but is also bound to postpone any fruitful negotiations its a bad signal esp for investors like us it shows poorly about how the indian polity works and how misplaced their priorities are esp on crucial infrastructure related issues some of us were beginning to think that dr lays visit is bound to enthuse the central government to act more positively and come with more likely solutions including a possible buyout however with a judicial probe being announced even the central government is forced to re think its strategy twice before stepping in infact it might be forced to take a back seat internal discussion reveal that it was perhaps necessary for dr lay to visit senior officials just to send a signal that enron had tried its utmost to thrash out a solution if necessary another visit would be planned just to reiterate this this they feel would help in the long run esp when we arbitrate to drive home the message that we did use all our options to arrive at a solution unlike the government which just was not forthcoming what folks here also feel is that the chairman of the company should definitely come to check the boxes so perhaps strategically it might appear that the latter school of thought is the right option but pragmatically sell out seems the only option left now the sooner the better however the way the judicial system works here one can only hope the supreme court respects our notice for arbitration in london and helps hasten the process ban,7224.,dr lays visit

1724,fyi rick this is very good and succinct summary from ban notwithstanding his analysis i think that we are going to be there for a longer than desired period and dr leys visit should have been kept for a more opportune time of course i hope that i am wrong it follows that the likely way out shall be renegotiation stabilizing then convergence with the arbitration route in existing best regards ai ban sharma am to amr ibrahim enron development enron development cc subject dr lays visit amr there have been differing perceptions about dr lays visit some including myself thought that it was a wasted effort esp so because just the day after he left the government of maharashtra called for a judicial probe against enron the terms of reference of the probe are to be announced within a month a judicial probe is not only a bad way to respond to our efforts but is also bound to postpone any fruitful negotiations its a bad signal esp for investors like us it shows poorly about how the indian polity works and how misplaced their priorities are esp on crucial infrastructure related issues some of us were beginning to think that dr lays visit is bound to enthuse the central government to act more positively and come with more likely solutions including a possible buyout however with a judicial probe being announced even the central government is forced to re think its strategy twice before stepping in infact it might be forced to take a back seat internal discussion reveal that it was perhaps necessary for dr lay to visit senior officials just to send a signal that enron had tried its utmost to thrash out a solution if necessary another visit would be planned just to reiterate this this they feel would help in the long run esp when we arbitrate to drive home the message that we did use all our options to arrive at a solution unlike the government which just was not forthcoming what folks here also feel is that the chairman of the company should definitely come to check the boxes so perhaps strategically it might appear that the latter school of thought is the right option but pragmatically sell out seems the only option left now the sooner the better however the way the judicial system works here one can only hope the supreme court respects our notice for arbitration in london and helps hasten the process ban,13032.,dr lays visit

1775,marvin the exhibit on the incentive fee calculation i just received is essentially the same as we have seen before and i still have the same overall comment unless i have some misunderstanding it seems to me that in a back to back transaction you could easily have a situation in which epmi is making a profit from a transaction on which the cities are losing money the savings per hour on which epmis profit sharing is based is only the difference between the market price what the purchaser agreed to pay and the cities target production cost incremental fuel cost and variable o m the savings per hour ignores all of the other costs that the cities may be obligated to pay under a back to back transaction such as transmission ancillary service imbalance congestion etc see the definition of costs below for example if the target production cost is mwh the market price mwh and transmission is mwh the cities would be paying epmi a profit sharing incentive fee of mwh while losing mwh on the sale transaction as i have noted before the savings on a transaction should be as follows savings revenues from the transaction production cost base on the target production cost and mwhs costs associated with the transaction incurred by epmi or the cities where costs include the items defined in article of the emsa we will get back to you later with comments on the other documents al definition of costs in the esma costs means when applicable to any transaction all costs liabilities fees and expenses incurred by epmi excluding epmis internal costs and allocated overhead in connection with the purchase sale replacement scheduling transmission and delivery of products and balancing services entered into between mdea epmi and third parties costs shall include but shall not be limited to i energy and fuel costs ii transmission costs and losses iii congestion costs iv scheduling fees v penalties inadvertent energy flow charges or imbalance charges that are exclusive of mdeas ancillary service charges vi taxes other than income taxes vii fees penalties or charges imposed by the spp serc iso or rto federal energy regulatory commission ferc or other similar authorities viii broker fees ix communication costs x other associated costs incurred by epmi al malmsjo r w beck office cell,6636.,beck comments on incentive fee exhibit

1779,the attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the commission this afternoon in order to provide ferc staffers a concise effective statement of our position while they drafted the judges recommendation i was able to schedule a meeting with judge wagner at which dan watkiss and i stepped the judge through the comments and hit the following high points the methodology of the june order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers if price mitigation is inevitable the judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology the judge should recommend that the end result of any commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods both prior to and after october all buyers including enron should be entitled to refunds not just the state of california and its ious enron is a net purchaser in these markets only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology not bilateral contracts oom sales or sales to the dwr the details of these points appear in the attached document the judge was receptive to most points he understood the problems that the june methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation he agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology although he agreed that the refund methodology once implemented should yield just and reasonable rates he felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the commission the judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations but hopefully this insight will shed some light as to the outcome i urged the judge to recommend placing conditions to refunds as the commission did in its june order with its rto filing requirement the judge was noncommittal on this although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset next steps include filing our detailed comments by thursday the judge told us he would certify his recommendation to the commission on friday and that the comments would accompany the recommendation thereafter it is likely that the commission would defer to the judges recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of days duration to determine unresolved issues of material fact the scope of the hearing has not been determined but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology,8807.,preliminary comments on judges recommendation

1781,steve here is a summary and copy of the congressman bartons electricity emergency relief bill per your request the republicans on the house energy and air quality subcommittee led by congressman barton have drafted legislation containing short term emergency measures to alleviate the crises in the western states comprising the western systems coordinating council such measures include a mandatory connection policy for distributed generation mobilizing the federal emergency management agency fema and compelling the formation of a western region rto barton plans introduce the bill at the end of april the bill is intended as a political response to democrats and the state of california little in the bill could be implemented by this summer and few of the provisions would have any beneficial impact on supply or demand thus there is an open question within the white house whether pursuit of the barton bill is the correct political tactic the belief among the industry is that it is going nowhere and it has already served its limited purpose of responding to democratic demands for action although a final decision on its inclusion has not been made enron has been initially successful in including its demand buy down proposal in the barton bill electricity emergency relief act pdf section by section introduced doc carin nersesian legislative coordinator enron corp eye st nw suite washington dc ph fax,5085.,the barton bill

1849,steve i hope things are going well for you larence snowden told me he met with you last week to discuss opportunities for him within the regulatory group as a courtesy follow up to that meeting i wanted to tell you about him and the skills i think he possesses larence spent working for different bosses in ebs and when the music stopped with me at the helm he had not produced enough identifiable work product for any one of us to be able to fall on our sword for him the double whammy was that he was at the point of aging out of the associate program and in need of a commercial position in my opinion larence was not suited to the type of work i need my people to do in ebs structuring and i had to pass on a promotion for him his ranking stems from the fact that he couldnt keep up with the other associates in the group with respect to hard core models and business analysis we eventually put him in the role of implementation where his main objectives have been to identify and overcome barriers to getting a deal up and running which everyone agrees is his strength he has good internal networking skills is a hard worker knows enron and communicates the essentials to management if thats what your team needs he may be a fit hopefully this goes without saying but please dont think of this as a no look pass larence needs to find a home on his own merits i just promised him that i would tell people the background details of his situation when appropriate thanks for talking to him and please call me if you have questions brad richter,2418.,larence snowden

1852,fyi to the executive committee attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off site and team building meetings my impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get togethers that require substantial travel our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time consuming for us to attend than our houston colleagues might realize often participating in these meetings takes an entire week for enron europe employees especially if they are outside of texas naturally they may feel that this time of year prc time is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering these off sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter which compounds the difficulty worse still are the times they occur at the end of q since it also coincides and conflicts with the prc process i would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs both direct and indirect when inviting international employees to off site meetings in the us we appreciate the chance to be included in the broader enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses thanks john sherriff letter sent to all enron europe vps and direct reports we still have issues regarding offsites and team building exercises in particular we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending in order to avoid misunderstandings and to increase transparency the following will apply with immediate effect any offsite or team building exercise which any group both commercial and non commercial and including john and myself intends to undertake must be communicated in advance to all department heads issue to be identified include all participants who will out of the office total costs of the exercise and where appropriate work load coverage details john and i are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends to the extent that is not possible we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered trips to houston and especially resorts in the us are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved so please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel please communicate this policy to your staff michael brown,12940.,transatlantic meetings

1966,folks had a good discussion with a senior staff member at ferc in preparation for the pipelines outreach meeting next week he told me that the two issues on the gas side that are of primary concern to the commission are marketing affiliates and potential abuse on the pipelines think el paso and the failure of cftc and or sec to more closely oversee derivative trading apparently staff is considering whether to ban all transactions by marketers on an affiliated pipeline and some form of filing reporting requirement to better understand the derivative market due to a lack of information some at ferc are assuming the worst i believe these proposals are in the formative stage and have not been presented to senior staff or commissioners as a recommendation i think staff would appreciate some information ammo to refute the need to further regulate marketing affiliates or delve into derivative trading ingaa filed comments and a study concerning marketers use of affiliated pipelines in response to the marketing affiliate conference at ferc these are attached staff questions whether the underlying information remains accurate we are considering whether to update the underlying information used in the ingaa study and how best to address these issues probably during q as during the staff outreach i believe it would be helpful to put back together the coalition that leslie lawner used at the last market affiliate conference to request a meeting as part of the current staff outreach to discuss staffs concerns in addition i think it would be helpful to request a separate enron meeting with staff to discuss how the derivative market works and why ferc does not need to establish ongoing reporting requirements or otherwise become involved in these markets unfortunately in this meeting we would probably be asked about our involvement in the el paso merchant transportation deal into california in light of peggy heggs comment on the frontline show that el paso hedged some of the risk with enron we can discuss further on fridays call later joe,8693.,ferc staff concerns on the gas side

2074,folks had a good discussion with a senior staff member at ferc in preparation for the pipelines outreach meeting next week he told me that the two issues on the gas side that are of primary concern to the commission are marketing affiliates and potential abuse on the pipelines think el paso and the failure of cftc and or sec to more closely oversee derivative trading apparently staff is considering whether to ban all transactions by marketers on an affiliated pipeline and some form of filing reporting requirement to better understand the derivative market due to a lack of information some at ferc are assuming the worst i believe these proposals are in the formative stage and have not been presented to senior staff or commissioners as a recommendation i think staff would appreciate some information ammo to refute the need to further regulate marketing affiliates or delve into derivative trading ingaa filed comments and a study concerning marketers use of affiliated pipelines in response to the marketing affiliate conference at ferc these are attached staff questions whether the underlying information remains accurate we are considering whether to update the underlying information used in the ingaa study and how best to address these issues probably during q as during the staff outreach i believe it would be helpful to put back together the coalition that leslie lawner used at the last market affiliate conference to request a meeting as part of the current staff outreach to discuss staffs concerns in addition i think it would be helpful to request a separate enron meeting with staff to discuss how the derivative market works and why ferc does not need to establish ongoing reporting requirements or otherwise become involved in these markets unfortunately in this meeting we would probably be asked about our involvement in the el paso merchant transportation deal into california in light of peggy heggs comment on the frontline show that el paso hedged some of the risk with enron we can discuss further on fridays call later joe,4671.,ferc staff concerns on the gas side

2129,from reg affairs house backs month delay in electric deregulation law by charles e beggs associated press writer may associated press newswires copyright the associated press all rights reserved salem ore ap the legislature on thursday took its biggest step so far toward delaying partial deregulation of business electricity rates when the house voted for an month postponement a bill passed by a vote would put off from oct to at least march the effective date of a law allowing the large business customers to buy power on the open market the bill goes to the senate where some changes are expected the law passed in doesnt change regulation of electricity rates for homes and small businesses the law would permit largest business and industrial customers of portland general electric and pacificorp the states two largest privately owned electric utilities to seek electricity on open markets backers of the delay say californias failed deregulation plan and uncertain hydropower supplies because of the northwests drought likely leading to rising power prices argue for postponing the change this gives us a better chance to look at where oregon is going said rep rob patridge r medford there are many uncertainties about the oregon law he said an month delay would put the issue back before lawmakers in their next session which would begin in january house speaker mark simmons r elgin said he expects the senate will push for a shorter deferral foes of the bill claimed it will not hold down rates and will only make the situation worse rep bill witt r portland said the problem is a lack of power supply to meet growing demand and that the measure chills investment in new capacity we are sending a clear signal that you cant do business in oregon because the rules are uncertain he said witt said the deregulation law was well crafted and doesnt contain the flaws that contributed to californias problems such as requirements forcing utilities to sell off generating plants however rep robert ackerman d eugene said the chaotic power market has created fear among businesses nonetheless and that some estimate they would face fourfold power increases in an unregulated market delay supporters said lawmakers are taking steps to stimulate more power production including passing a bill to streamline siting of temporary generating plants which gov john kitzhaber has signed,13075.,oregon house back month delay

2190,i had a hard time logging on remotely so i just got this now as you can see its a relatively brief overview presentation for jeff not going into much of the detail surrounding for example performance criteria and evaluation or job classification where much of the real work remains the main purpose of this presentation is to give jeff something for the december board meeting i need your thoughts on something one of the rationales i had discussed with mckinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for talent a partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity and reduced hierarchy in an organization it also creates substantial upside opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership my question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes to attracting and retaining talent my suspicion is that our turnover is farily low and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the organization where we run into problems my gut tells me is that we have some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools ie we often lose out to the i banks and perhaps mckinsey level consulting firms and that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors ie were ok at the top livels already could you have someone do an analysis of the turnover rates at different levels we may need to weed out the performance related departures including those who left after getting a low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for performance reasons if possible steve attached is a draft of the pack we plan to use in our discussion with jeff next week as you might imagine weve been going through many iterations of this document and it is still very much a work in process hopefully you can get a sense of the outline and where we are heading but the specific points on each page will continue to be wordsmithed we look forward to getting your reaction feedback to the structure and overall message suzanne asked me to give you her home number where you can reach her over the weekend otherwise please feel free to leave a voicemail for either suzanne or me thanks dan marcontell see attached file dmc ppt this message may contain confidential and or privileged information if you are not the addressee or authorized to receive this for the addressee you must not use copy disclose or take any action based on this message or any information herein if you have received this message in error please advise the sender immediately by reply e mail and delete this message thank you for your cooperation dmc ppt,2033.,draft document for next week

2200,fyi can we get a copy best jeff officials criticize energy report posted at p m pdt thursday june by chris obrien mercury news californias energy crisis is expected to increase unemployment reduce production and aggravate an already weakening economy according to researchers at the university of california los angeles the impact however will likely depend on how state officials choose to deal with the failed deregulation scheme the authors of the report released thursday come down heavily in favor of lifting price controls and dramatically increasing the price consumers pay as a way to reduce the economic fallout californias economy is sufficiently large and dynamic that it will weather the current power crisis without being derailed the report says however our analysis reveals that this impact can be moderated by an approach that does not shift todays problems to tomorrow the study short circuit will the california energy crisis derail the states economy came under fierce criticism from gov gray davis office steven maviglio davis spokesman said many of the assumptions used to produce the report are either outdated or flat wrong it deserves its rightful place sitting on the shelf gathering dust maviglio said like any crystal ball report its essentially irrelevant edward lamer a ucla professor and christopher thornberg a visiting professor at ucla collaborated on the report with a team of researchers from the cambridge energy research associates the study concludes that californias gross state product will be cut by anywhere from percent to percent in as a result of the energy crisis in addition energy problems will increase unemployment by percent in and percent in the report predicts consumers can expect hours of rolling blackouts this year however the report argues that the impact could be dramatically reduced if the state would raise the price consumers pay for energy to match the wholesale costs this could reduce blackouts to hours lower the debt and interest the state will have to pay for electricity and encourage investment in the state to increase energy supplies but peter navarro a management professor at the university of california irvine was skeptical of the reports findings he said it was almost impossible to build models complex enough to take into account all the factors that affect energy prices in the state in addition he said the report seems to assume that there is no manipulation of the current market which navarro argues could be distorting prices as well how do you justify raising retail rates to cents for power that costs a nickel to generate when there is some evidence that the market is flawed navarro said this report seems to have an industry point of view and an industry agenda,28218.,officials criticize energy report

2486,fyi to the executive committee attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off site and team building meetings my impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get togethers that require substantial travel our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time consuming for us to attend than our houston colleagues might realize often participating in these meetings takes an entire week for enron europe employees especially if they are outside of texas naturally they may feel that this time of year prc time is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering these off sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter which compounds the difficulty worse still are the times they occur at the end of q since it also coincides and conflicts with the prc process i would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs both direct and indirect when inviting international employees to off site meetings in the us we appreciate the chance to be included in the broader enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses thanks john sherriff letter sent to all enron europe vps and direct reports we still have issues regarding offsites and team building exercises in particular we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending in order to avoid misunderstandings and to increase transparency the following will apply with immediate effect any offsite or team building exercise which any group both commercial and non commercial and including john and myself intends to undertake must be communicated in advance to all department heads issue to be identified include all participants who will out of the office total costs of the exercise and where appropriate work load coverage details john and i are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends to the extent that is not possible we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered trips to houston and especially resorts in the us are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved so please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel please communicate this policy to your staff michael brown,7147.,transatlantic meetings

2569,steve rick below is a brief description of dan recks recent acquisition of webmodal l please read the following message from dan reck regarding webmodal thank you daniel reck pm to cathy phillips hou ect ect cc subject webmodal at mondays egm meeting mike mcconnell asked me to describe the webmodal acquisition egm made last week following is a brief description of the freight capacity market and what webmodal gets us market the us market for logistics is bn annually we are pursuing the largest homogenous segment which is long haul truckload and intermodal that market is bn annually depending on who you ask and whether you include dedicated fleets the interesting thing about these markets is that they are extremely fragmented and massively intermediated there are over trucking companies carriers in the us and thousands of independent brokers brokers in this market act as credit principals of all loads are conducted in the spot market brokered and the rest are done under year contracts that are generally non firm but define the relationship between each shipper and their chosen carriers or intermediaries on the rail side the us railroads act as wholesalers selling their capacity to intermodal marketing companies imcs the imcs then retail or broker out that capacity to shippers the difficult part of ground intermodal is that the rail haul makes up only the long haul component the trip from the origin warehouse to the origin rail yard and then the delivery from the destination rail yard to the destination warehouse has to be done by truck this first and last mile transportation is called drayage webmodal webmodal developed a system to price and schedule intermodal moves so they look identical to truck they have a database with prices and schedules from all the rrs and drayage companies that gives them complete us coverage a buyer can type in their scheduling and equipment requirements and receive instantaneous quotes for zipcode to zipcode service because of the inherently different cost and performance structures of rail and truck the pricing differences between the two modes of transportation is significant for any move greater than miles intermodal is generally less expensive than a single driver truck move the substitutability of intermodal and truckload should allow us to trade the spread in price the webmodal acquisition gets us a team with tremendous industry expertise and a good head start as we enter this market the next move will be to build a truck intermediation capability i encourage you to meet chris kravas the ceo of webmodal he will be spending all of his time in houston when he is not on the road please give me a call if you have any questions thanks dan reck,7470.,webmodal
