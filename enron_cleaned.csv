440,preliminary comments on judges recommendation,the attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the commission this afternoon in order to provide ferc staffers a concise effective statement of our position while they drafted the judges recommendation i was able to schedule a meeting with judge wagner at which dan watkiss and i stepped the judge through the comments and hit the following high points the methodology of the june order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers if price mitigation is inevitable the judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology the judge should recommend that the end result of any commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods both prior to and after october all buyers including enron should be entitled to refunds not just the state of california and its ious enron is a net purchaser in these markets only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology not bilateral contracts oom sales or sales to the dwr the details of these points appear in the attached document the judge was receptive to most points he understood the problems that the june methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation he agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology although he agreed that the refund methodology once implemented should yield just and reasonable rates he felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the commission the judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations but hopefully this insight will shed some light as to the outcome i urged the judge to recommend placing conditions to refunds as the commission did in its june order with its rto filing requirement the judge was noncommittal on this although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset next steps include filing our detailed comments by thursday the judge told us he would certify his recommendation to the commission on friday and that the comments would accompany the recommendation thereafter it is likely that the commission would defer to the judges recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of days duration to determine unresolved issues of material fact the scope of the hearing has not been determined but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology,28563.

756,mtbe legislation,today senators bob smith r nh and harry reid d nv will introduce an mtbe bill which is expected to be slightly different than weve seen in previous congresses we expect it to include a year date certain to eliminate mtbe with epa determining the phaseout schedule a lifting of the oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by state governors within days from date of enactment and environmental anti backsliding provision focused only on air toxics and using a baseline with a percent standard the way i understand it right now rfg must perform better than baseline for conventional gasoline provisions for mtbe producer transition assistance brief analysis well have more details shortly but the bill looks a little better than previous efforts a number of bills have been introduced this congress but this will probably be the leading effort as you know enron has led efforts to include the transition assistance piece which is still largely undefined in the legislation but we are pleased with the inclusion of a placeholder while the senate decides on the best approach we will continue to lead the development of such incentives which will likely take the form of epa doe funding for mtbe producers who convert plants to produce iso octane or alkylate an mtbe ban is of course not good but a date certain gives producers more flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under several steps of a phase out allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy standard is probably a given in any legislation but will face some opposition from the ethanol community who just want a simple mtbe ban the anti backsliding provision is still being refined but looks fairly lame we need more details to make an accurate assessment but its likely that environmental groups will want a bit more one political factor with sen jim jeffords leaving the republican party democrats will be given control of the senate environment committee which will consider this bill they will likely allow jeffords to chair the committee the significance is that sen bob smith r nh is the current chair and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on mtbe in losing the chairmanship his legislation may face a longer road through committee i will keep you posted as the legislation evolves jeffrey keeler director environmental strategies enron washington dc office cell phone,8602.

839,dr lays visit,fyi rick this is very good and succinct summary from ban notwithstanding his analysis i think that we are going to be there for a longer than desired period and dr leys visit should have been kept for a more opportune time of course i hope that i am wrong it follows that the likely way out shall be renegotiation stabilizing then convergence with the arbitration route in existing best regards ai ban sharma am to amr ibrahim enron development enron development cc subject dr lays visit amr there have been differing perceptions about dr lays visit some including myself thought that it was a wasted effort esp so because just the day after he left the government of maharashtra called for a judicial probe against enron the terms of reference of the probe are to be announced within a month a judicial probe is not only a bad way to respond to our efforts but is also bound to postpone any fruitful negotiations its a bad signal esp for investors like us it shows poorly about how the indian polity works and how misplaced their priorities are esp on crucial infrastructure related issues some of us were beginning to think that dr lays visit is bound to enthuse the central government to act more positively and come with more likely solutions including a possible buyout however with a judicial probe being announced even the central government is forced to re think its strategy twice before stepping in infact it might be forced to take a back seat internal discussion reveal that it was perhaps necessary for dr lay to visit senior officials just to send a signal that enron had tried its utmost to thrash out a solution if necessary another visit would be planned just to reiterate this this they feel would help in the long run esp when we arbitrate to drive home the message that we did use all our options to arrive at a solution unlike the government which just was not forthcoming what folks here also feel is that the chairman of the company should definitely come to check the boxes so perhaps strategically it might appear that the latter school of thought is the right option but pragmatically sell out seems the only option left now the sooner the better however the way the judicial system works here one can only hope the supreme court respects our notice for arbitration in london and helps hasten the process ban,8742.

909,blackout notification,after months of effort we have succeeded in putting together a blackout notification system that will provide california employers residents and public safety officers with adequate time to respond to an impending rolling blackout as you know governor davis appointed me to the california iso last february through the leadership of our energy committee at the manufacturing group i introduced a motion at caiso on march the motion stated that california needed a better blackout notification system than the passive system previously in place after the motion passed the iso and pg e held focus groups with employers and residents throughout the state to ask customers what they need to more adequately prepare for planned rolling blackouts and if possible to help prevent them from occurring then governor davis stepped in and directed iso the office of emergency services and the energy oversight board to work with the utilities to build a proactive notification system this system provides not only a hour advanced warning before a blackout could occur but to also includes and hour notices that blackouts might happen due to predicted hot weather conditions and or a lack of energy supply or planned and unplanned maintenance at generation facilities the proactive approach sought by governor davis and by my motion at caiso will include a system by which residents and employers can have their extensive contact information such e mails pagers and cell phones listed in a database all contacts can receive a and hour automatic notification in advance what is particularly exciting about this proactive approach is that we can better prepare for a blackout with adequate time to power down assembly lines and computers and power up emergency generators we can also prevent a blackout by taking action within that hour which reduces load and can even help avoid blackouts again kudos go to the manufacturing groups energy committee for pushing this plan last february to take to the caiso board and to governor davis by expanding this plan we can make sure an even larger window of notice is proactively provided to californians the plan will be rolled out publicly tomorrow friday june and incrementally implemented as soon as possible we will soon provide further updates on how employers throughout the valley and state on how they can register in the new database for this proactive notification system sincerely carl guardino winmail dat,27900.

1354,consulting agreements with lobbyists,fyi as you know in the last few months we have had discussions regarding the retention of lobbyists to perform services on our florida power development projects it was decided that we would have the lobbyists retained through the government affairs group two recent agreements one with quantum results and another with tripp scott provided for payments to be made at certain junctures of our development process it has come to our attention that these payments were not timely made in order to make sure that we dont inadvertently miss any future payments i am proposing that we continue to retain the consultants through execution of a consulting services agreement signed by government affairs the consulting agreements will be prepared in duplicate originals so that the lobbyist keeps one copy and enron keeps one copy legal will retain enrons executed original and provide it to kay young who maintains a database of all consulting agreements and confidentiality agreements entered into by ena entities legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to government affairs for their records legal will distribute a copy of the executed document to kathleen carnahan who will set up a payment schedule unlike our real property option agreements that have a date certain for payment these agreements often have payment schedules dependent upon some approval process thus it will be important for all of us to keep kathleen in the loop as to dates of hearings or approvals so that she will know if it is time for a payment kathleen will provide notices to government affairs that a payment is due and the amount of the payment and arrange for reimbursement of such payment out of the development groups rc government affairs will make the payments and be reimbursed out of the development groups rc please advise if this system will work for you so that we can undertake to have kathleen begin setting up a payment schedule my strong preference is that we continue to keep things flowing through the government affairs group so that we consistently maintain the lobbyist relationship however this will require government affairs have some way of monitoring the agreements i think we fix that problem with having kathleen keep a consultant schedule just as she keeps an option schedule im going on vacation as of next wednesday so your response by tuesday will be greatly appreciated,5836.

1395,we have resolved the bpa james river contract,all i am pleased to report that we have resolved the infamous james river contract with bpa under favorable terms the signed agreements are on my desk right now besides significantly reducing our litigation risk the addition of mw h and the change of delivery point have added million to the value of the contract bpa and epmi have amended the original contract to specify that i bpa will deliver mw h for the year term of the agreement an increase of mw h over the original ii the disputed alternative delivery point is designated as mid c iii all language to the contrary is deleted from the agreement iv the parties agree to book out the james river physical deliveries against epmi sales to bpa at the mid c delivery point so no power will flow and v we will continue to invoice bpa each month for the term of the agreement just as if the power was still flowing although my preference would have been to terminate the james river agreement bpa refused to do so because it would not have been able to recover the costs of this contract in its rates similarly i had hoped that we could do a one time book out but bpa refused to do so because according to bpas finance person such a book out would have converted this to a financial deal requiring bpa to use mark to market accounting therefore we executed two documents one amending the original contract and another called the book out agreement which sets out an agreement to book out specific transactions over the next five years i am satisfied that this is a favorable deal for epmi because we resolve the disputes over quantity and delivery point which will make it very difficult for bpa to change its mind in the future and argue that we are not entitled to receive power unless we are selling it to james river and the negotiated increase in quantity and change in delivery point add over million in value to the contract thanks to everyone for your help steve,213.

1477,preliminary comments on judges recommendation,the attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the commission this afternoon in order to provide ferc staffers a concise effective statement of our position while they drafted the judges recommendation i was able to schedule a meeting with judge wagner at which dan watkiss and i stepped the judge through the comments and hit the following high points the methodology of the june order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers if price mitigation is inevitable the judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology the judge should recommend that the end result of any commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods both prior to and after october all buyers including enron should be entitled to refunds not just the state of california and its ious enron is a net purchaser in these markets only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology not bilateral contracts oom sales or sales to the dwr the details of these points appear in the attached document the judge was receptive to most points he understood the problems that the june methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation he agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology although he agreed that the refund methodology once implemented should yield just and reasonable rates he felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the commission the judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations but hopefully this insight will shed some light as to the outcome i urged the judge to recommend placing conditions to refunds as the commission did in its june order with its rto filing requirement the judge was noncommittal on this although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset next steps include filing our detailed comments by thursday the judge told us he would certify his recommendation to the commission on friday and that the comments would accompany the recommendation thereafter it is likely that the commission would defer to the judges recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of days duration to determine unresolved issues of material fact the scope of the hearing has not been determined but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology,8807.

1509,ferc staff concerns on the gas side,folks had a good discussion with a senior staff member at ferc in preparation for the pipelines outreach meeting next week he told me that the two issues on the gas side that are of primary concern to the commission are marketing affiliates and potential abuse on the pipelines think el paso and the failure of cftc and or sec to more closely oversee derivative trading apparently staff is considering whether to ban all transactions by marketers on an affiliated pipeline and some form of filing reporting requirement to better understand the derivative market due to a lack of information some at ferc are assuming the worst i believe these proposals are in the formative stage and have not been presented to senior staff or commissioners as a recommendation i think staff would appreciate some information ammo to refute the need to further regulate marketing affiliates or delve into derivative trading ingaa filed comments and a study concerning marketers use of affiliated pipelines in response to the marketing affiliate conference at ferc these are attached staff questions whether the underlying information remains accurate we are considering whether to update the underlying information used in the ingaa study and how best to address these issues probably during q as during the staff outreach i believe it would be helpful to put back together the coalition that leslie lawner used at the last market affiliate conference to request a meeting as part of the current staff outreach to discuss staffs concerns in addition i think it would be helpful to request a separate enron meeting with staff to discuss how the derivative market works and why ferc does not need to establish ongoing reporting requirements or otherwise become involved in these markets unfortunately in this meeting we would probably be asked about our involvement in the el paso merchant transportation deal into california in light of peggy heggs comment on the frontline show that el paso hedged some of the risk with enron we can discuss further on fridays call later joe,8693.

1638,view on exit fees,wednesday morning june before the cpuc decision to delay the vote on da i gave marty sunde this view on exit fees and surcharges for dwr costs in the california market there is a probability that customers who go to direct access and who used utility service between january and june will pay an exit fee calculated as the difference between market price and utility rates during that period the exit fee could also include the going forward costs or alternatively those costs could be passed along in the form of a uniform surcharge in other words with regard to past costs regulators or legislators would require da customers to pay the amount they belive had been sucked from the state during the january june crisis period i said the retroactive ratemaking argument is a nicety that california could easily dispense with now that we know the cpuc decision will be delayed i think the probability of exit fees for retroactive costs is even higher either the da legislation will pass between now and july or carl wood will change the puc order to get the jailbreaking customers to pay up,28198.

1831,california,executive summary cpuc rules that socal must pay of debt to qfs approximately million ruling heightens likelihood of voluntary bankruptcy filing by socal voluntary filing further heightened by successful ring fencing by eix parent bankruptcy judge firm in support for qfs report socal loses cpuc ruling but retains appeal option as you may have seen bloomberg reported that the cpuc voted to force socal to make of its payments owed to alternative energy producers in california cpuc rules allow days to appeal its rulings leaving a window open for socal to buy more time voluntary filing in with regard to a socal bankruptcy filing the key now is how socals board feels about progress rather than deadlines with creditors in other words sources believe that a voluntary filing is more likely than an involuntary filing a continuing lack of progress on a bailout and an increase in the number of liens filed against socal is more likely to make the socal board want to file for bankrutpcy voluntarily the recent ring fencing by edison international reflects their need to pay off cross default risk and to cut ties in their bank facility between the parent company and lines of credit helds by socal in and of outself it does not necessarily signal an imminent filing involuntary out sources indicate that the unsecured financial creditors are not considering a filing against socal this is because the financial creditors believe that they would still be worse off in bankruptcy sources report that in creditor discussions there has not been talk of the debt holders not being paid people have talked about screwing the generators and everyone else but not the debt holders a source commented the qfs are unlikely to file against socal because they have fairly good contracts in place also they receive high capacity fees in the summer these fees vary seasonally and are distinct from generating fees these capacity fees are calculated on a rolling year basis and will be re calculated next year the qfs want this summer included in the recalculation incentivizing them to keep their contracts in place montali supporting qfs judge montali by his recent rulings is sending a signal that he is concerned for the qfs and is sensitive to their hardships he is trying to help them through his rulings for example as long as qfs remain on line those who petition can receive additional payments from pg e over a month period these payments equal of the qfs pre petition claims this provides the qfs incentive to remain connected to pg e ge looking to restructure generating capacity financing general electric is reportedly deeply concerned about the stability of financing generating capacity in the us ge has over of the gas turbine market ge is reportedly trying to keep its margins down and is not raising its prices due to concerns about instability sources believe that a very significant percentage of generating capacity financing will have to be restrucured in five years,27818.

1871,preliminary comments on judges recommendation,the attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the commission this afternoon in order to provide ferc staffers a concise effective statement of our position while they drafted the judges recommendation i was able to schedule a meeting with judge wagner at which dan watkiss and i stepped the judge through the comments and hit the following high points the methodology of the june order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers if price mitigation is inevitable the judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology the judge should recommend that the end result of any commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods both prior to and after october all buyers including enron should be entitled to refunds not just the state of california and its ious enron is a net purchaser in these markets only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology not bilateral contracts oom sales or sales to the dwr the details of these points appear in the attached document the judge was receptive to most points he understood the problems that the june methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation he agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology although he agreed that the refund methodology once implemented should yield just and reasonable rates he felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the commission the judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations but hopefully this insight will shed some light as to the outcome i urged the judge to recommend placing conditions to refunds as the commission did in its june order with its rto filing requirement the judge was noncommittal on this although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset next steps include filing our detailed comments by thursday the judge told us he would certify his recommendation to the commission on friday and that the comments would accompany the recommendation thereafter it is likely that the commission would defer to the judges recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of days duration to determine unresolved issues of material fact the scope of the hearing has not been determined but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology,12967.

2068,transatlantic meetings,fyi to the executive committee attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off site and team building meetings my impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get togethers that require substantial travel our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time consuming for us to attend than our houston colleagues might realize often participating in these meetings takes an entire week for enron europe employees especially if they are outside of texas naturally they may feel that this time of year prc time is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering these off sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter which compounds the difficulty worse still are the times they occur at the end of q since it also coincides and conflicts with the prc process i would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs both direct and indirect when inviting international employees to off site meetings in the us we appreciate the chance to be included in the broader enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses thanks john sherriff letter sent to all enron europe vps and direct reports we still have issues regarding offsites and team building exercises in particular we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending in order to avoid misunderstandings and to increase transparency the following will apply with immediate effect any offsite or team building exercise which any group both commercial and non commercial and including john and myself intends to undertake must be communicated in advance to all department heads issue to be identified include all participants who will out of the office total costs of the exercise and where appropriate work load coverage details john and i are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends to the extent that is not possible we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered trips to houston and especially resorts in the us are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved so please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel please communicate this policy to your staff michael brown,12940.

2298,dr lays visit,fyi rick this is very good and succinct summary from ban notwithstanding his analysis i think that we are going to be there for a longer than desired period and dr leys visit should have been kept for a more opportune time of course i hope that i am wrong it follows that the likely way out shall be renegotiation stabilizing then convergence with the arbitration route in existing best regards ai ban sharma am to amr ibrahim enron development enron development cc subject dr lays visit amr there have been differing perceptions about dr lays visit some including myself thought that it was a wasted effort esp so because just the day after he left the government of maharashtra called for a judicial probe against enron the terms of reference of the probe are to be announced within a month a judicial probe is not only a bad way to respond to our efforts but is also bound to postpone any fruitful negotiations its a bad signal esp for investors like us it shows poorly about how the indian polity works and how misplaced their priorities are esp on crucial infrastructure related issues some of us were beginning to think that dr lays visit is bound to enthuse the central government to act more positively and come with more likely solutions including a possible buyout however with a judicial probe being announced even the central government is forced to re think its strategy twice before stepping in infact it might be forced to take a back seat internal discussion reveal that it was perhaps necessary for dr lay to visit senior officials just to send a signal that enron had tried its utmost to thrash out a solution if necessary another visit would be planned just to reiterate this this they feel would help in the long run esp when we arbitrate to drive home the message that we did use all our options to arrive at a solution unlike the government which just was not forthcoming what folks here also feel is that the chairman of the company should definitely come to check the boxes so perhaps strategically it might appear that the latter school of thought is the right option but pragmatically sell out seems the only option left now the sooner the better however the way the judicial system works here one can only hope the supreme court respects our notice for arbitration in london and helps hasten the process ban,13032.

2301,transatlantic meetings,fyi to the executive committee attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off site and team building meetings my impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get togethers that require substantial travel our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time consuming for us to attend than our houston colleagues might realize often participating in these meetings takes an entire week for enron europe employees especially if they are outside of texas naturally they may feel that this time of year prc time is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering these off sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter which compounds the difficulty worse still are the times they occur at the end of q since it also coincides and conflicts with the prc process i would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs both direct and indirect when inviting international employees to off site meetings in the us we appreciate the chance to be included in the broader enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses thanks john sherriff letter sent to all enron europe vps and direct reports we still have issues regarding offsites and team building exercises in particular we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending in order to avoid misunderstandings and to increase transparency the following will apply with immediate effect any offsite or team building exercise which any group both commercial and non commercial and including john and myself intends to undertake must be communicated in advance to all department heads issue to be identified include all participants who will out of the office total costs of the exercise and where appropriate work load coverage details john and i are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends to the extent that is not possible we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered trips to houston and especially resorts in the us are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved so please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel please communicate this policy to your staff michael brown,8834.

2556,investigation of corruption in the turkish energy sector private,fyi private confidential eric shaws team has learned that an investigation has been initiated by th e turkish military to expose and eliminate corruption in the turkish energy sector on january the military took seven energy sector bureaucrats into custod y in the following days other officials from tea the electricity generatio n monopoly and the ministry of energy and natural resources menr and executives from a number of turkish companies were also taken into custody while many of the bureaucrats and executives have been released a leaked report from the military investigators suggests that the operation is wide ranging and may ultimately target the minister of energy and natural resources and other senior energy sector bureaucrats and businessmen enron implications trakya one turkish newspaper has reported that enron s mw trakya power project was being investigated this has not been reported anywhere else because the power price at trakya has been the target of criticism in the past we are not surprised by this report although an investigation is always a possibility other than the one newspaper report there has been n o indication official or otherwise that an investigation is planned or underway gama it has also been reported that the wife of gorkhan yardim the gener al manager of bota the natural gas monopoly works at gama our turkish partner in the trakya project and that his expensive car was a gift from gama gama has told us and yardim has defended himself publicly by saying that his wife has been working at gama since long before yardim had risen to his current position of power at bota and that the car was not a gift from gama it is worth noting however that there have been a number of newspaper reports questioning gama s role in a controversial gas marketi ng deal being undertaken by their turrusgas joint venture with gazprom and bot a outlook it is still not clear how or when this investigation will end in the mediu m and long term this will be good news for enron and other reputable turkish or foreign companies which have found it difficult to do transparent energy deals in turkey in the past in the short term however it is likely to result in a marked decrease in meaningful activity in the turkish energy sector as worried bureaucrats innocent and guilty lay low we will continue to monitor developments especially with regard to the trakya project and report as necessary,7305.

2600,ncng delivery points,i dont think she finished her thought ill check with allyson on this kay there would seem to me to be two questions the threshold one is whether the site is within rocky mounts service territory if it is then what obligation does ncng have with respect to the construction of a delivery point i havent reviewed the annexation statutes yet but based on my initial reading of the service area territory agreement between rocky mount and ncng once annexed the site would come within rocky mounts purview to serve and although a mutually agreeable delivery point would have to be negotiated ncng would at least have to negotiate that in good faith the january service area territory agreement gives rocky mount the right to distribute natural gas within the citys incorporated limits as well as a specified area outside the incorporated limits the contract goes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed into the city the respective rights of the parties as to service in any such portion shall be determined by applicable case law and the general statutes of north carolina the contract further provides that absent an order of the ncuc to the contrary ncng agrees that rocky mount has the right to serve all end users within the aforementioned area presumably referring to the annexed area although the agreement is not a model of clarity so at least based on this language rocky mounts right to serve arguably tracks its incorporated limits whatever they might be jonathan and i are looking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there the service agreement provides in article iv provides that points of devliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreement with ncng shall be at the following locations and other stations added at mutually agreeable locations in the future in the third amendment to the natural gas service agreement dated march new language and delivery points are negotiated upon but the principle is still included that other stations may be added at mutually agreeable locations in the future the question which then arises is what rocky mount would have to give in exchange in the agreement rocky mount agreed to an extention of terms of the of ten years until december,3825.
