167,fyi to the executive committee attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off site and team building meetings my impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get togethers that require substantial travel our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time consuming for us to attend than our houston colleagues might realize often participating in these meetings takes an entire week for enron europe employees especially if they are outside of texas naturally they may feel that this time of year prc time is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering these off sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter which compounds the difficulty worse still are the times they occur at the end of q since it also coincides and conflicts with the prc process i would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs both direct and indirect when inviting international employees to off site meetings in the us we appreciate the chance to be included in the broader enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses thanks john sherriff letter sent to all enron europe vps and direct reports we still have issues regarding offsites and team building exercises in particular we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending in order to avoid misunderstandings and to increase transparency the following will apply with immediate effect any offsite or team building exercise which any group both commercial and non commercial and including john and myself intends to undertake must be communicated in advance to all department heads issue to be identified include all participants who will out of the office total costs of the exercise and where appropriate work load coverage details john and i are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends to the extent that is not possible we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered trips to houston and especially resorts in the us are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved so please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel please communicate this policy to your staff michael brown,2489.,transatlantic meetings

658,the attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the commission this afternoon in order to provide ferc staffers a concise effective statement of our position while they drafted the judges recommendation i was able to schedule a meeting with judge wagner at which dan watkiss and i stepped the judge through the comments and hit the following high points the methodology of the june order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers if price mitigation is inevitable the judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology the judge should recommend that the end result of any commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods both prior to and after october all buyers including enron should be entitled to refunds not just the state of california and its ious enron is a net purchaser in these markets only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology not bilateral contracts oom sales or sales to the dwr the details of these points appear in the attached document the judge was receptive to most points he understood the problems that the june methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation he agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology although he agreed that the refund methodology once implemented should yield just and reasonable rates he felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the commission the judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations but hopefully this insight will shed some light as to the outcome i urged the judge to recommend placing conditions to refunds as the commission did in its june order with its rto filing requirement the judge was noncommittal on this although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset next steps include filing our detailed comments by thursday the judge told us he would certify his recommendation to the commission on friday and that the comments would accompany the recommendation thereafter it is likely that the commission would defer to the judges recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of days duration to determine unresolved issues of material fact the scope of the hearing has not been determined but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology,7171.,preliminary comments on judges recommendation

747,today senators bob smith r nh and harry reid d nv will introduce an mtbe bill which is expected to be slightly different than weve seen in previous congresses we expect it to include a year date certain to eliminate mtbe with epa determining the phaseout schedule a lifting of the oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by state governors within days from date of enactment and environmental anti backsliding provision focused only on air toxics and using a baseline with a percent standard the way i understand it right now rfg must perform better than baseline for conventional gasoline provisions for mtbe producer transition assistance brief analysis well have more details shortly but the bill looks a little better than previous efforts a number of bills have been introduced this congress but this will probably be the leading effort as you know enron has led efforts to include the transition assistance piece which is still largely undefined in the legislation but we are pleased with the inclusion of a placeholder while the senate decides on the best approach we will continue to lead the development of such incentives which will likely take the form of epa doe funding for mtbe producers who convert plants to produce iso octane or alkylate an mtbe ban is of course not good but a date certain gives producers more flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under several steps of a phase out allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy standard is probably a given in any legislation but will face some opposition from the ethanol community who just want a simple mtbe ban the anti backsliding provision is still being refined but looks fairly lame we need more details to make an accurate assessment but its likely that environmental groups will want a bit more one political factor with sen jim jeffords leaving the republican party democrats will be given control of the senate environment committee which will consider this bill they will likely allow jeffords to chair the committee the significance is that sen bob smith r nh is the current chair and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on mtbe in losing the chairmanship his legislation may face a longer road through committee i will keep you posted as the legislation evolves jeffrey keeler director environmental strategies enron washington dc office cell phone,4762.,mtbe legislation

1123,california power price boost not needed agency says update by daniel taub sacramento california july bloomberg california regulators wont need to raise electricity prices for consumers to cover a planned billion bond sale said a spokesman for the agency that buys power on behalf of the states utilities the california department of water resources which has spent more than billion on power this year is expected to recommend a rate increase of as much as percent dow jones reported today citing three unnamed members of the states public utilities commission oscar hidalgo a spokesman for the agency said no rate increase is expected our folks are stunned by this revelation because it is nowhere near what our numbers show hidalgo said in fact our numbers show that there is no need for any increase beyond whats already been done the department of water resources will submit a report to the california public utilities commission today or monday with the states revenue requirements for repaying a planned billion bond sale hidalgo said the bonds are to be repaid by customers of utilities owned by pg e corp edison international and sempra energy the bond sales the largest municipal offering in u s history are scheduled to begin in september governor gray davis has said repeatedly that he believes the bonds can be repaid without further rate increases his position hasnt changed spokesman steve maviglio said today previous increases in march the puc voted to boost rates by cents a kilowatt hour at the states two largest utilities rates at pg es pacific gas electric the largest california utility would rise by as much as percent and southern california edison rates would rise by as much as percent the puc said at the time the average consumer price increase would be percent the puc said the increase the second this year was intended to help the state pay for power purchases the puc voted in january to raise rates about percent california treasurer philip angelides has said that the bonds will let the state cushion the immediate rate impact on residents and businesses by spreading power costs over time the debt will be repaid over years investors have said they cant predict how the bonds will be received without knowing how much cushion is built into the revenue pledge backing the debt legislation that paved the way for the bonds allows the state to raise electricity rates as needed to cover debt repayment that pledge typical for revenue bonds usually entails a promise to raise a specific level of money annually to cover interest and principal payments on the debt and provide an added cushion that formula known as a debt service coverage ratio must result in investment grade ratings for californias power bonds according to the legislation investors want assurance that an issuer will raise rates to maintain the promised cushion even if increases arent needed at the time of the bond sale,28745.,california power price boost not needed agency says update

1570,the attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the commission this afternoon in order to provide ferc staffers a concise effective statement of our position while they drafted the judges recommendation i was able to schedule a meeting with judge wagner at which dan watkiss and i stepped the judge through the comments and hit the following high points the methodology of the june order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers if price mitigation is inevitable the judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology the judge should recommend that the end result of any commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods both prior to and after october all buyers including enron should be entitled to refunds not just the state of california and its ious enron is a net purchaser in these markets only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology not bilateral contracts oom sales or sales to the dwr the details of these points appear in the attached document the judge was receptive to most points he understood the problems that the june methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation he agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology although he agreed that the refund methodology once implemented should yield just and reasonable rates he felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the commission the judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations but hopefully this insight will shed some light as to the outcome i urged the judge to recommend placing conditions to refunds as the commission did in its june order with its rto filing requirement the judge was noncommittal on this although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset next steps include filing our detailed comments by thursday the judge told us he would certify his recommendation to the commission on friday and that the comments would accompany the recommendation thereafter it is likely that the commission would defer to the judges recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of days duration to determine unresolved issues of material fact the scope of the hearing has not been determined but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology,12967.,preliminary comments on judges recommendation

1879,executive summary cpuc rules that socal must pay of debt to qfs approximately million ruling heightens likelihood of voluntary bankruptcy filing by socal voluntary filing further heightened by successful ring fencing by eix parent bankruptcy judge firm in support for qfs report socal loses cpuc ruling but retains appeal option as you may have seen bloomberg reported that the cpuc voted to force socal to make of its payments owed to alternative energy producers in california cpuc rules allow days to appeal its rulings leaving a window open for socal to buy more time voluntary filing in with regard to a socal bankruptcy filing the key now is how socals board feels about progress rather than deadlines with creditors in other words sources believe that a voluntary filing is more likely than an involuntary filing a continuing lack of progress on a bailout and an increase in the number of liens filed against socal is more likely to make the socal board want to file for bankrutpcy voluntarily the recent ring fencing by edison international reflects their need to pay off cross default risk and to cut ties in their bank facility between the parent company and lines of credit helds by socal in and of outself it does not necessarily signal an imminent filing involuntary out sources indicate that the unsecured financial creditors are not considering a filing against socal this is because the financial creditors believe that they would still be worse off in bankruptcy sources report that in creditor discussions there has not been talk of the debt holders not being paid people have talked about screwing the generators and everyone else but not the debt holders a source commented the qfs are unlikely to file against socal because they have fairly good contracts in place also they receive high capacity fees in the summer these fees vary seasonally and are distinct from generating fees these capacity fees are calculated on a rolling year basis and will be re calculated next year the qfs want this summer included in the recalculation incentivizing them to keep their contracts in place montali supporting qfs judge montali by his recent rulings is sending a signal that he is concerned for the qfs and is sensitive to their hardships he is trying to help them through his rulings for example as long as qfs remain on line those who petition can receive additional payments from pg e over a month period these payments equal of the qfs pre petition claims this provides the qfs incentive to remain connected to pg e ge looking to restructure generating capacity financing general electric is reportedly deeply concerned about the stability of financing generating capacity in the us ge has over of the gas turbine market ge is reportedly trying to keep its margins down and is not raising its prices due to concerns about instability sources believe that a very significant percentage of generating capacity financing will have to be restrucured in five years,27818.,california

1928,fyi private confidential eric shaws team has learned that an investigation has been initiated by th e turkish military to expose and eliminate corruption in the turkish energy sector on january the military took seven energy sector bureaucrats into custod y in the following days other officials from tea the electricity generatio n monopoly and the ministry of energy and natural resources menr and executives from a number of turkish companies were also taken into custody while many of the bureaucrats and executives have been released a leaked report from the military investigators suggests that the operation is wide ranging and may ultimately target the minister of energy and natural resources and other senior energy sector bureaucrats and businessmen enron implications trakya one turkish newspaper has reported that enron s mw trakya power project was being investigated this has not been reported anywhere else because the power price at trakya has been the target of criticism in the past we are not surprised by this report although an investigation is always a possibility other than the one newspaper report there has been n o indication official or otherwise that an investigation is planned or underway gama it has also been reported that the wife of gorkhan yardim the gener al manager of bota the natural gas monopoly works at gama our turkish partner in the trakya project and that his expensive car was a gift from gama gama has told us and yardim has defended himself publicly by saying that his wife has been working at gama since long before yardim had risen to his current position of power at bota and that the car was not a gift from gama it is worth noting however that there have been a number of newspaper reports questioning gama s role in a controversial gas marketi ng deal being undertaken by their turrusgas joint venture with gazprom and bot a outlook it is still not clear how or when this investigation will end in the mediu m and long term this will be good news for enron and other reputable turkish or foreign companies which have found it difficult to do transparent energy deals in turkey in the past in the short term however it is likely to result in a marked decrease in meaningful activity in the turkish energy sector as worried bureaucrats innocent and guilty lay low we will continue to monitor developments especially with regard to the trakya project and report as necessary,6059.,investigation of corruption in the turkish energy sector private

1996,the following notes are from ken smith from state controller kathleen connells press conference today california state controller kathleen connell held a press conference today although the dow newswire said it would be to disclose long term contracts the event focused on what she believes will be an additional need for borrowing beyond the energy bonds she anticipates an additional billion in borrowing will be needed in february to meet expected costs the borrowing should she said be done as revenue anticipation notes rans short term notes at a lower interest rates about that must be paid back by the end of the year rather than as additional energy bonds she categorized the current budget situation as the same kind of environment as a bad budget year and said california should maintain at least a reserve she did not comment on individual contracts except to say there are different contracts charts her office had prepared showed that billion had been spent on energy purchases through about of that went to spot market purchases there was also a chart that showed projected expenditures under the governor s plan to be billion for the period january june with about of that going to spot market purchases how these numbers work together was confusing i checked with a reporter who said he was also unclear i ll try to get this cleared up this afternoon an easel held a large photocopy of a million check to mirant which is the largest energy check written to date more has been paid to reliant she put it at about of total expenditures but we have never written a check to reliant over million because of the way they invoice she said the governor s financial assumptions for power do not fit i nto the most likely scenario and that summer conditions will greatly affect the actual spending needs she noted that dwr estimates it will spend billion through june although the puc has only authorized billion the other significant announcement was that she plans to use her authority with the board of equalization to hold hearings to determine whether power plants sold by utilities have been properly assessed for property taxes apparently they are still on the tax rolls at previous rates but she believes the profits recorded by some generators means the plants may be more valuable than their current assessments a press release was not distributed at the event although there may be one issued later today,4815.,kathleen connell

2060,today senators bob smith r nh and harry reid d nv will introduce an mtbe bill which is expected to be slightly different than weve seen in previous congresses we expect it to include a year date certain to eliminate mtbe with epa determining the phaseout schedule a lifting of the oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by state governors within days from date of enactment and environmental anti backsliding provision focused only on air toxics and using a baseline with a percent standard the way i understand it right now rfg must perform better than baseline for conventional gasoline provisions for mtbe producer transition assistance brief analysis well have more details shortly but the bill looks a little better than previous efforts a number of bills have been introduced this congress but this will probably be the leading effort as you know enron has led efforts to include the transition assistance piece which is still largely undefined in the legislation but we are pleased with the inclusion of a placeholder while the senate decides on the best approach we will continue to lead the development of such incentives which will likely take the form of epa doe funding for mtbe producers who convert plants to produce iso octane or alkylate an mtbe ban is of course not good but a date certain gives producers more flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under several steps of a phase out allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy standard is probably a given in any legislation but will face some opposition from the ethanol community who just want a simple mtbe ban the anti backsliding provision is still being refined but looks fairly lame we need more details to make an accurate assessment but its likely that environmental groups will want a bit more one political factor with sen jim jeffords leaving the republican party democrats will be given control of the senate environment committee which will consider this bill they will likely allow jeffords to chair the committee the significance is that sen bob smith r nh is the current chair and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on mtbe in losing the chairmanship his legislation may face a longer road through committee i will keep you posted as the legislation evolves jeffrey keeler director environmental strategies enron washington dc office cell phone,8602.,mtbe legislation

2337,today senators bob smith r nh and harry reid d nv will introduce an mtbe bill which is expected to be slightly different than weve seen in previous congresses we expect it to include a year date certain to eliminate mtbe with epa determining the phaseout schedule a lifting of the oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by state governors within days from date of enactment and environmental anti backsliding provision focused only on air toxics and using a baseline with a percent standard the way i understand it right now rfg must perform better than baseline for conventional gasoline provisions for mtbe producer transition assistance brief analysis well have more details shortly but the bill looks a little better than previous efforts a number of bills have been introduced this congress but this will probably be the leading effort as you know enron has led efforts to include the transition assistance piece which is still largely undefined in the legislation but we are pleased with the inclusion of a placeholder while the senate decides on the best approach we will continue to lead the development of such incentives which will likely take the form of epa doe funding for mtbe producers who convert plants to produce iso octane or alkylate an mtbe ban is of course not good but a date certain gives producers more flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under several steps of a phase out allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy standard is probably a given in any legislation but will face some opposition from the ethanol community who just want a simple mtbe ban the anti backsliding provision is still being refined but looks fairly lame we need more details to make an accurate assessment but its likely that environmental groups will want a bit more one political factor with sen jim jeffords leaving the republican party democrats will be given control of the senate environment committee which will consider this bill they will likely allow jeffords to chair the committee the significance is that sen bob smith r nh is the current chair and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on mtbe in losing the chairmanship his legislation may face a longer road through committee i will keep you posted as the legislation evolves jeffrey keeler director environmental strategies enron washington dc office cell phone,3387.,mtbe legislation

2368,the attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the commission this afternoon in order to provide ferc staffers a concise effective statement of our position while they drafted the judges recommendation i was able to schedule a meeting with judge wagner at which dan watkiss and i stepped the judge through the comments and hit the following high points the methodology of the june order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers if price mitigation is inevitable the judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology the judge should recommend that the end result of any commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods both prior to and after october all buyers including enron should be entitled to refunds not just the state of california and its ious enron is a net purchaser in these markets only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology not bilateral contracts oom sales or sales to the dwr the details of these points appear in the attached document the judge was receptive to most points he understood the problems that the june methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation he agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology although he agreed that the refund methodology once implemented should yield just and reasonable rates he felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the commission the judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations but hopefully this insight will shed some light as to the outcome i urged the judge to recommend placing conditions to refunds as the commission did in its june order with its rto filing requirement the judge was noncommittal on this although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset next steps include filing our detailed comments by thursday the judge told us he would certify his recommendation to the commission on friday and that the comments would accompany the recommendation thereafter it is likely that the commission would defer to the judges recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of days duration to determine unresolved issues of material fact the scope of the hearing has not been determined but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology,28563.,preliminary comments on judges recommendation
2369,a conference call is scheduled at p m today re the cpuc decision suspending direct access the dial in no for this call is as follows passcode conf room ebc is reserved for your use the following points highlight legal regulatory recommendations to the business team on the da suspension issue all intelligence indicates that the cpuc will act on this issue at its june meeting and there are sufficient votes for the decision existing contracts it is our recommendation that ees should submit any and all dasrs to initiate da service to the appropriate utility no later than june for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to ensure da service new contracts all new contracts should be signed by both ees and the customer no later than june july is a sunday dasrs for these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate utility as soon as possible but in no event later than july the july date is our estimate of the last date the utility would accept dasrs for new contracts it is important to note that the cpuc is keeping the clock on contract execution timing switching option customers that are on da service can be returned to the utility per the tariff process once the customer has been returned to utility service after july our expectation is that there will be no ability to have this customer receive da service in a future timeframe in addition returning to utility service may incur a re entry fee contract extensions ees should consider amending all current contracts that terminate after july with a evergreen provision that provides for index pricing with day cancellation notice provisions these amendments should be signed prior to june it is possible that the cpuc will require marketers to detail the termination dates of their da customers one additional thought ees may consider having the customer assign any negative ctc receivable to ees as compensation for the evergreen provision to overcome the cpuc language that indicates that the customer is due the negative ctc credit we intend to set up a call for pm houston time today to discuss call in number to follow jim,28017.,cpuc decision suspending direct access

2375,the following notes are from ken smith from state controller kathleen connells press conference today california state controller kathleen connell held a press conference today although the dow newswire said it would be to disclose long term contracts the event focused on what she believes will be an additional need for borrowing beyond the energy bonds she anticipates an additional billion in borrowing will be needed in february to meet expected costs the borrowing should she said be done as revenue anticipation notes rans short term notes at a lower interest rates about that must be paid back by the end of the year rather than as additional energy bonds she categorized the current budget situation as the same kind of environment as a bad budget year and said california should maintain at least a reserve she did not comment on individual contracts except to say there are different contracts charts her office had prepared showed that billion had been spent on energy purchases through about of that went to spot market purchases there was also a chart that showed projected expenditures under the governor s plan to be billion for the period january june with about of that going to spot market purchases how these numbers work together was confusing i checked with a reporter who said he was also unclear i ll try to get this cleared up this afternoon an easel held a large photocopy of a million check to mirant which is the largest energy check written to date more has been paid to reliant she put it at about of total expenditures but we have never written a check to reliant over million because of the way they invoice she said the governor s financial assumptions for power do not fit i nto the most likely scenario and that summer conditions will greatly affect the actual spending needs she noted that dwr estimates it will spend billion through june although the puc has only authorized billion the other significant announcement was that she plans to use her authority with the board of equalization to hold hearings to determine whether power plants sold by utilities have been properly assessed for property taxes apparently they are still on the tax rolls at previous rates but she believes the profits recorded by some generators means the plants may be more valuable than their current assessments a press release was not distributed at the event although there may be one issued later today,3341.,kathleen connell

2410,steve as you requested attached please find the analyst compensation comparables we discussed last week we are having an extremely tough time recruiting analysts from rice because our main competition on campus comes from consulting companies bain mckinsey bcg ey andersen etc and investment banks goldman jp morgan csfb merrill lynch etc even though these companies are not directly in our industry group they are our principal competitors for talent at rice as evidenced by our recruiting performance this year and in previous years we loose nearly every time when we compete with these companies in the last three years of recruiting at rice only or people have accepted our offer the other analysts who are rice alumni myself included joined enron through other circumstances i think our poor performance at rice is due primarily to the following factors compensation the enron compensation package is below that of our competitors at rice additionally there is more risk associated with our offer since enrons compensation structure relies more heavily on the year end bonus than some of our competitors in the cases where the package is similar ie mckinsey we loose folks because of other companys name and prestige rotations most investment banks give their analysts offers to work in specific groups m a trading etc our analyst recruits can express a preference but their placement is not guaranteed this also creates an added element of risk and uncertainty in sum i think we will continue to be unsuccessful in our recruiting efforts at rice if we do not address these issues should you need any further information please feel free to contact me regards alex hernandez ena principal investments charlene as we discussed yesterday attached please find a comparable compensation analysis for this years analyst offers we believe that the low acceptance rate we are experiencing this year is due to the following reasons enrons base salary is significantly below that of our competitors the bonus ranges were not mentioned in the offer letters i hope this information is useful to you as we continue our efforts to attract quality employees to enron should you have any questions please feel free to contact me regards alex hernandez analyst advisory board x,6872.,rice recruiting analyst compensation comparables

2460,fyi rick this is very good and succinct summary from ban notwithstanding his analysis i think that we are going to be there for a longer than desired period and dr leys visit should have been kept for a more opportune time of course i hope that i am wrong it follows that the likely way out shall be renegotiation stabilizing then convergence with the arbitration route in existing best regards ai ban sharma am to amr ibrahim enron development enron development cc subject dr lays visit amr there have been differing perceptions about dr lays visit some including myself thought that it was a wasted effort esp so because just the day after he left the government of maharashtra called for a judicial probe against enron the terms of reference of the probe are to be announced within a month a judicial probe is not only a bad way to respond to our efforts but is also bound to postpone any fruitful negotiations its a bad signal esp for investors like us it shows poorly about how the indian polity works and how misplaced their priorities are esp on crucial infrastructure related issues some of us were beginning to think that dr lays visit is bound to enthuse the central government to act more positively and come with more likely solutions including a possible buyout however with a judicial probe being announced even the central government is forced to re think its strategy twice before stepping in infact it might be forced to take a back seat internal discussion reveal that it was perhaps necessary for dr lay to visit senior officials just to send a signal that enron had tried its utmost to thrash out a solution if necessary another visit would be planned just to reiterate this this they feel would help in the long run esp when we arbitrate to drive home the message that we did use all our options to arrive at a solution unlike the government which just was not forthcoming what folks here also feel is that the chairman of the company should definitely come to check the boxes so perhaps strategically it might appear that the latter school of thought is the right option but pragmatically sell out seems the only option left now the sooner the better however the way the judicial system works here one can only hope the supreme court respects our notice for arbitration in london and helps hasten the process ban,7224.,dr lays visit

2915,the attached preliminary comments were finalized and filed with the commission this afternoon in order to provide ferc staffers a concise effective statement of our position while they drafted the judges recommendation i was able to schedule a meeting with judge wagner at which dan watkiss and i stepped the judge through the comments and hit the following high points the methodology of the june order does not work and is totally inappropriate for marketers if price mitigation is inevitable the judge should formulate or make allowances for a workable methodology the judge should recommend that the end result of any commission order must be a just and reasonable finding for all periods both prior to and after october all buyers including enron should be entitled to refunds not just the state of california and its ious enron is a net purchaser in these markets only the state administered spot markets should be subject to the methodology not bilateral contracts oom sales or sales to the dwr the details of these points appear in the attached document the judge was receptive to most points he understood the problems that the june methodology presents for marketers and was agreeable to the notion that this should be addressed perhaps in the context of the hearings that will form part of his recommendation he agreed that the actual buyers should receive refunds and it was his understanding that only spot transactions should be subject to the refund methodology although he agreed that the refund methodology once implemented should yield just and reasonable rates he felt that this was outside the scope of his recommendation and that the matter was up to the commission the judge spoke generally and no promises were made as to the content of his recommendations but hopefully this insight will shed some light as to the outcome i urged the judge to recommend placing conditions to refunds as the commission did in its june order with its rto filing requirement the judge was noncommittal on this although he did indicate that he felt refunds should be subject to offset next steps include filing our detailed comments by thursday the judge told us he would certify his recommendation to the commission on friday and that the comments would accompany the recommendation thereafter it is likely that the commission would defer to the judges recommendation to hold a fast track evidentiary hearing of days duration to determine unresolved issues of material fact the scope of the hearing has not been determined but will probably include cost issues and might serve as a vehicle for marketers to recommend an alternative methodology,8807.,preliminary comments on judges recommendation

2922,steve here is a summary and copy of the congressman bartons electricity emergency relief bill per your request the republicans on the house energy and air quality subcommittee led by congressman barton have drafted legislation containing short term emergency measures to alleviate the crises in the western states comprising the western systems coordinating council such measures include a mandatory connection policy for distributed generation mobilizing the federal emergency management agency fema and compelling the formation of a western region rto barton plans introduce the bill at the end of april the bill is intended as a political response to democrats and the state of california little in the bill could be implemented by this summer and few of the provisions would have any beneficial impact on supply or demand thus there is an open question within the white house whether pursuit of the barton bill is the correct political tactic the belief among the industry is that it is going nowhere and it has already served its limited purpose of responding to democratic demands for action although a final decision on its inclusion has not been made enron has been initially successful in including its demand buy down proposal in the barton bill electricity emergency relief act pdf section by section introduced doc carin nersesian legislative coordinator enron corp eye st nw suite washington dc ph fax,5085.,the barton bill

2938,steve ive been discussing some of the back web issues with mike harris from ees i dont think the ibm proprietary software will be an issue but we still have to sort out conflicts with tibco which appears to be quite a popular tool at enron now that i have analyzed this project with my it hat on i would like to suggest that we enlist the services of a business analyst from enron net works we do have a technical team members from enw but they are focused on the architecture and design of the system and might inadvertantly miss some of the user specific issues involved with a roll out of this magnitude enw will have ultimate responsiblity for deploying backweb and it would be in their best interests to assign a business analyst at the front end in fact it is probably appropriate to have a business analyst from ees and one from ets working on this team as well we have to keep field personnel in mind with a project of this scope and the business units will understand the unique issues of their own users much better than we at corp could hope to do the windows teams at each business unit would probably have the most suitable people to commit to this project as they have so recently undertaken a similar deployment i want to be sure we are including everyone who should be involved courtney and i can certainly speak to the requirements for corp but i dont want to presume to speak for ees or ets does this sound reasonable to you if so i will contact the appropriate people at enw ees and ets to find a business analyst from each group thanks er,2074.,backweb mike harris

3040,fyi to the executive committee attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off site and team building meetings my impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get togethers that require substantial travel our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time consuming for us to attend than our houston colleagues might realize often participating in these meetings takes an entire week for enron europe employees especially if they are outside of texas naturally they may feel that this time of year prc time is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering these off sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter which compounds the difficulty worse still are the times they occur at the end of q since it also coincides and conflicts with the prc process i would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs both direct and indirect when inviting international employees to off site meetings in the us we appreciate the chance to be included in the broader enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses thanks john sherriff letter sent to all enron europe vps and direct reports we still have issues regarding offsites and team building exercises in particular we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending in order to avoid misunderstandings and to increase transparency the following will apply with immediate effect any offsite or team building exercise which any group both commercial and non commercial and including john and myself intends to undertake must be communicated in advance to all department heads issue to be identified include all participants who will out of the office total costs of the exercise and where appropriate work load coverage details john and i are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends to the extent that is not possible we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered trips to houston and especially resorts in the us are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved so please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel please communicate this policy to your staff michael brown,12940.,transatlantic meetings

3093,steve i wanted to give you the latest figures on enron expatriates in india there are currently enron expatriate employees based in india accompanied by six dependants in addition enron has responsibility for expatriate contractors working for dpc and lingtec primarily at dabhol the total of expatriates for whom enron is directly responsible is broken down by location as follows in mumbai at dabhol and three in baroda by company they are broken down as follows enron india eight plus three dependants eogil nine plus one dependant ebs one plus two dependants dpc seven and lingtec nine these figures are likely to continue to trend downward jane wilsons departure on friday for example will reduce the enron india expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants we are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the event of danger as a contingency the plan also includes the evacuation of all expatriates working at the dabhol site although a large scale evacuation from dabhol is more problematic especially now that the monsoon season has started a coordinated plan was needed since the limited number of available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by individual contractors such as bechtel were all drawing upon the same resources as you know enrons security situation in india remains stable we are in the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and offices there dave,12779.,enron expatriates in india

3232,folks had a good discussion with a senior staff member at ferc in preparation for the pipelines outreach meeting next week he told me that the two issues on the gas side that are of primary concern to the commission are marketing affiliates and potential abuse on the pipelines think el paso and the failure of cftc and or sec to more closely oversee derivative trading apparently staff is considering whether to ban all transactions by marketers on an affiliated pipeline and some form of filing reporting requirement to better understand the derivative market due to a lack of information some at ferc are assuming the worst i believe these proposals are in the formative stage and have not been presented to senior staff or commissioners as a recommendation i think staff would appreciate some information ammo to refute the need to further regulate marketing affiliates or delve into derivative trading ingaa filed comments and a study concerning marketers use of affiliated pipelines in response to the marketing affiliate conference at ferc these are attached staff questions whether the underlying information remains accurate we are considering whether to update the underlying information used in the ingaa study and how best to address these issues probably during q as during the staff outreach i believe it would be helpful to put back together the coalition that leslie lawner used at the last market affiliate conference to request a meeting as part of the current staff outreach to discuss staffs concerns in addition i think it would be helpful to request a separate enron meeting with staff to discuss how the derivative market works and why ferc does not need to establish ongoing reporting requirements or otherwise become involved in these markets unfortunately in this meeting we would probably be asked about our involvement in the el paso merchant transportation deal into california in light of peggy heggs comment on the frontline show that el paso hedged some of the risk with enron we can discuss further on fridays call later joe,8693.,ferc staff concerns on the gas side

3418,folks had a good discussion with a senior staff member at ferc in preparation for the pipelines outreach meeting next week he told me that the two issues on the gas side that are of primary concern to the commission are marketing affiliates and potential abuse on the pipelines think el paso and the failure of cftc and or sec to more closely oversee derivative trading apparently staff is considering whether to ban all transactions by marketers on an affiliated pipeline and some form of filing reporting requirement to better understand the derivative market due to a lack of information some at ferc are assuming the worst i believe these proposals are in the formative stage and have not been presented to senior staff or commissioners as a recommendation i think staff would appreciate some information ammo to refute the need to further regulate marketing affiliates or delve into derivative trading ingaa filed comments and a study concerning marketers use of affiliated pipelines in response to the marketing affiliate conference at ferc these are attached staff questions whether the underlying information remains accurate we are considering whether to update the underlying information used in the ingaa study and how best to address these issues probably during q as during the staff outreach i believe it would be helpful to put back together the coalition that leslie lawner used at the last market affiliate conference to request a meeting as part of the current staff outreach to discuss staffs concerns in addition i think it would be helpful to request a separate enron meeting with staff to discuss how the derivative market works and why ferc does not need to establish ongoing reporting requirements or otherwise become involved in these markets unfortunately in this meeting we would probably be asked about our involvement in the el paso merchant transportation deal into california in light of peggy heggs comment on the frontline show that el paso hedged some of the risk with enron we can discuss further on fridays call later joe,4671.,ferc staff concerns on the gas side

3603,i had a hard time logging on remotely so i just got this now as you can see its a relatively brief overview presentation for jeff not going into much of the detail surrounding for example performance criteria and evaluation or job classification where much of the real work remains the main purpose of this presentation is to give jeff something for the december board meeting i need your thoughts on something one of the rationales i had discussed with mckinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for talent a partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity and reduced hierarchy in an organization it also creates substantial upside opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership my question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes to attracting and retaining talent my suspicion is that our turnover is farily low and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the organization where we run into problems my gut tells me is that we have some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools ie we often lose out to the i banks and perhaps mckinsey level consulting firms and that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors ie were ok at the top livels already could you have someone do an analysis of the turnover rates at different levels we may need to weed out the performance related departures including those who left after getting a low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for performance reasons if possible steve attached is a draft of the pack we plan to use in our discussion with jeff next week as you might imagine weve been going through many iterations of this document and it is still very much a work in process hopefully you can get a sense of the outline and where we are heading but the specific points on each page will continue to be wordsmithed we look forward to getting your reaction feedback to the structure and overall message suzanne asked me to give you her home number where you can reach her over the weekend otherwise please feel free to leave a voicemail for either suzanne or me thanks dan marcontell see attached file dmc ppt this message may contain confidential and or privileged information if you are not the addressee or authorized to receive this for the addressee you must not use copy disclose or take any action based on this message or any information herein if you have received this message in error please advise the sender immediately by reply e mail and delete this message thank you for your cooperation dmc ppt,2033.,draft document for next week

4112,fyi to the executive committee attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off site and team building meetings my impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get togethers that require substantial travel our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time consuming for us to attend than our houston colleagues might realize often participating in these meetings takes an entire week for enron europe employees especially if they are outside of texas naturally they may feel that this time of year prc time is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering these off sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter which compounds the difficulty worse still are the times they occur at the end of q since it also coincides and conflicts with the prc process i would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs both direct and indirect when inviting international employees to off site meetings in the us we appreciate the chance to be included in the broader enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses thanks john sherriff letter sent to all enron europe vps and direct reports we still have issues regarding offsites and team building exercises in particular we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending in order to avoid misunderstandings and to increase transparency the following will apply with immediate effect any offsite or team building exercise which any group both commercial and non commercial and including john and myself intends to undertake must be communicated in advance to all department heads issue to be identified include all participants who will out of the office total costs of the exercise and where appropriate work load coverage details john and i are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends to the extent that is not possible we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered trips to houston and especially resorts in the us are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved so please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel please communicate this policy to your staff michael brown,7147.,transatlantic meetings

4144,fyi to the executive committee attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off site and team building meetings my impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get togethers that require substantial travel our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time consuming for us to attend than our houston colleagues might realize often participating in these meetings takes an entire week for enron europe employees especially if they are outside of texas naturally they may feel that this time of year prc time is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering these off sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter which compounds the difficulty worse still are the times they occur at the end of q since it also coincides and conflicts with the prc process i would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs both direct and indirect when inviting international employees to off site meetings in the us we appreciate the chance to be included in the broader enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses thanks john sherriff letter sent to all enron europe vps and direct reports we still have issues regarding offsites and team building exercises in particular we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending in order to avoid misunderstandings and to increase transparency the following will apply with immediate effect any offsite or team building exercise which any group both commercial and non commercial and including john and myself intends to undertake must be communicated in advance to all department heads issue to be identified include all participants who will out of the office total costs of the exercise and where appropriate work load coverage details john and i are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends to the extent that is not possible we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered trips to houston and especially resorts in the us are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved so please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel please communicate this policy to your staff michael brown,8834.,transatlantic meetings
