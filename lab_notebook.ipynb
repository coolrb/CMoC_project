    "We first updated our Github repo (https://github.com/formidify/CMoC_project): the read_me and todo files. We also created this Jupyter notebook to keep track of our progress. Then, we created a Python file to clean the Enron email dataset by including only the subjects and body (for now) of each email, as well as basic data cleaning such as removing symbols and common stop words (such as 'a', 'and' and 'an', etc.). We also got rid of reply and forward emails, as well as emails whose subjects include significant words that do not appear in the body (such that we can run extractive summarisation on that email)."
