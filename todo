process data to extract well-formatted title and body text
cut data so that body text that doesn't contain every title word is excluded
come up with a basic idea for how our LSTM architecture could be formatted wrt layers, forward and backward pass, etc.
pick a framework to do our LSTM in
figure out how to make an LSTM in that framework
make forward passing and backwards passing LSTMs
figure out hyperparameters etc.
